# ProjectEuler

Solutions for some of the Project Euler problems, available at https://projecteuler.net/.

Please DO NOT browse through the code unless you have solved the problems yourself or have no interest in doing so.
Project Euler advises against sharing the code in order to avoid taking the fun away of people who are looking for hints/ideas on how to solve the problems, so if hints are what you're looking for, you won't find them here. 

The reason I chose to share my solutions here is that GitHub is a much better place to look at code than Project Euler's forums. I find it interesting to look at other people's solutions after I've solved a problem, and I'm sure a lot of people like it too, so here it is!
